Step 1: Create repo on github
Step 2: Create a design for the assignment (stack) REST-api? or graphql? Which test framework? just unit tests or integration test?
  What kind of DB?
Step 3: Create skeleton/ boilerplate code with spring.io or should I use openapi spec?
step 4: Link to github and push first commit from IDE
Step 5: Write tests for first usecase
Step 6: Implement code to make the tests pass

1. Customer can log in
• Precondition: Login credentials are stored in the database (not hashed).
• HTTP Method: POST
• Request:
{
"email":"info@filmland-assessment.nl",
"password":"Javaiscool90"
}
• Action: Check if the login is valid.
• Response:
{
"status":"Login successful/Login failed",
"message":"make a nice message"
}
• BONUS: The password is hashed into the database.
• BONUS: Make an authorisation key and use this key with all requests to the server.

2. Getting categories
• HTTP Method: GET
• Prerequisite: The user is authenticated. Only the username needs to be sent to the back-end.
• Action: Getting all the available categories and the subscribed categories of the authenticated
subscriber.
• Response:
{
"availableCategories":[
{
"name":"Dutch Films",
"availableContent":10,
"price":4.0
},
{
"name":"Dutch Series",
"availableContent":20,
"price":6.0
}
],
"subscribedCategories":[
{
"name":"International Films",
"remainingContent":5,
"price":8.0,
"startDate":"01-01-2018"
}
]
}
3. Customer can subscribe to a category
• HTTP Method: POST
• Request:
{
"email":"info@filmland-assessment.nl",
"availableCategory":"Dutch Films"
}
• Action: The first month is free; after this month, the subscriber needs to pay for the service.
You may add a payment date to the database. Make some logical business rules, e.g. a
subscriber cannot subscribe to a service he/she is already subscribed to.
• Response:
{
"status":"Login successful/Login failed",
"message":"make a nice message"
}
• BONUS: Instead of using the payment date in the database, solve the problem by using a
scheduler.
4. Subscriber can share a category
• HTTP Method: POST
• Request:
{
"email":"info@filmland-assessment.nl",
"customer":"client@filmland-assessment.nl",
"subscribedCategory":"Dutch Films"
}
• Action: It is possible to share a subscription with an existing customer. This will start as soon
as this option is selected. The costs and the remaining content will need to be shared among
both customers.
• Response:
{
"status":"Login successful/Login failed",
"message":"make a nice message"
}
